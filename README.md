##### Gilded Rose Tech Test

### Checklist

- Separate folders
- Test items
- Test gilded rose class
- Add inheritance for items class
- Edit tests to pass for each new item subclass
- refactor rspec tests
- refactor code
- edit readme

### Process

- Initially I started by separating the files into relevant folders, then initialising a proper test framework after removing the older one.
- Not being able to tamper with the item class, I added 4 tests to make sure it works correctly
